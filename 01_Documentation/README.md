# User and Developer Manual

## Manual

The TeX source and files containing all diagrams is loacted in the `source/` directory.

To compile the manual to a pdf file, run
```
$ ./01_Manual.Compile.sh
```

This script simply runs xelatex inside the source directory, and moves
the resultant pdf file here. Several Latex packages are required.
