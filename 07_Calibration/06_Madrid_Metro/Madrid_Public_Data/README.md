# Extraction of Data from Wikipedia

## Raw data

These files represent the sequence of steps via which sane csv files were produced given raw Wikipedia HTML input.
They are not expected to be useful as other than an example, as data formats and conventions are not only unspecified,
but change over time.

Running of the gawk scripts here is inadvisable, except in the case of adapting them to perform extraction of a similar
metro system from a similar source.

The final product is in the *007*csv files, describing the Madrid Metro.
