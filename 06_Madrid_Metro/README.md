# Madrid Metro

## Preparation of .zim input files.

In the ZimInput directory,

* `00_StaticTypes.zim`

describes the global attributes of the system. The rest of the input
files are

* `_01_Stations.zim`
* `_02_Tracks.zim`
* `_03_Paths.zim`
* `_04_Schedules.zim`
* `_05_Demand.zim`

which are all generated by the command
```
$ ./01_Make_Whole_System_and_Demand.sh
```
This reads the `Madrid_Public_Data/*007*csv` files and produces the description of the
metro system in terms of zboxen.

## Output

`out` is currently a symbolic link. Before running the simulation,
either change it to a directory or point it at one.

In turn, within the `07_Calibration` and `08_Simulation_Results` directories,
`out` symlinks link to the above `06_Madrid_Metro/out`.

## Running the simulation

For example:

```
$ ./02_Run_Simulation.sh z=30
```
